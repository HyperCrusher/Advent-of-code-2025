# Advent of Code 2025
This is my repo for solving Advent of Code 2025

I decided that while Im going through tne Rust Programming Language book that I should take the things I learn and try to do AoC this year :)
solutions are mostly for Rust practice obviously and are most certainly not idiomatic, or performant
